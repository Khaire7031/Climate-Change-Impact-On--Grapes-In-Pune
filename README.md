# Climate Change Impact on Human Health in India

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the effects of climate change on human health in India. By examining meteorological data and its correlations with various health indicators, we seek to understand how changing climate patterns impact public health, socio-economic factors, and overall well-being. The project focuses on studying temperature, precipitation, humidity, UV index, and other climate variables to identify trends, anomalies, and potential risks to human populations.

## Data

The project utilizes meteorological data sourced from reputable sources such as national weather agencies and climate research organizations. Data preprocessing scripts are used to clean and format the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency. The dataset includes variables such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, UV index, and atmospheric pressure, recorded at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) across different regions in India.

## Analysis

Statistical analysis techniques are applied to explore relationships between climate variables and human health indicators. Long-term trends, seasonal variations, and extreme weather events are analyzed to assess the impacts of climate change on public health, agriculture, water resources, and infrastructure. Advanced modeling and machine learning algorithms may be employed to predict future climate scenarios and potential health outcomes.

## Visualization

Data visualization techniques are used to present findings and insights in a clear and accessible manner. Charts, graphs, maps, and interactive dashboards are created to illustrate trends, patterns, and correlations in the data. Visualizations help stakeholders, policymakers, and the general public understand the complex interactions between climate change and human health and inform decision-making and adaptation strategies.
