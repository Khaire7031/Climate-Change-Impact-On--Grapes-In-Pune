# Climate Change Impact on Agricluture in Pune

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the effects of climate change on human health in Pune. By examining meteorological data and its correlations with various health indicators, we seek to understand how changing climate patterns impact public health, socio-economic factors, and overall well-being. The project focuses on studying temperature, precipitation, humidity, UV index, and other climate variables to identify trends, anomalies, and potential risks to human populations.
